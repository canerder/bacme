bash-acme
=====

This is a simple shell script for requesting a certificate from the
Let's Encrypt CA using the ACME protocol, a modified version of [bacme](https://gitlab.com/sinclair2/bacme).

Simplifications for example are:

- supports ACMEv2 (RFC 8555) only, not the deprecated ACMEv1
- supports http validation only
- keys are not reused but regenerated every time
  - both the account key and the domain key
  - in part this is also because of privacy considerations

The script is intentionally made so by default it will not do anything on your
server by itself. There is no need that you have to run it directly on your
server (as root or otherwise). You keep control over the validation and
installation process.
A typical automated renewal process would be to let the script generate new
private keys, automate the http validation by using a SSH key authenticated
rsync with the --webroot option and installing the generated keys and
certificates via e.g. an Ansible playbook.

The script is intended to be easy to understand but still allow the complete
automatic generation of a certificate.
It is also a working small example to learn the ACME protocol.

Installation
------------

To create bash-acme in current directory:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canerder/bash-acme/master/bash-acme > ./bash-acme && chmod +x ./bash-acme
```

Usage
-----

```
Usage: ./bash-acme [options...] <domain> [ <domain> ... ]
Options:
  -e, --email EMAIL         Your email if you want that Let's Encrypt can contact you
  -h, --help                This help
  -t, --test                Use staging API of Let's Encrypt for testing the script
  -v, --verbose             Verbose mode, print additional debug output
  -w, --webroot DIRECTORY   Path to the DocumentRoot of your webserver. Can be a rsync
                            compatible remote location like www@myserver:/srv/www/htdocs/.

The first domain parameter should be your main domain name with the subdomains following after it.

Example: ./bash-acme -e me@example.com -w www@server:/var/www/example/ example.com www.example.com
```
bash-acme will save the key and cert files in a directory corresponding with the domain name, in the same directory as the bash-acme script.
```
bash-acme
example.com üìÅ
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ account.key
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ account.pub
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example.com.key <-- private key
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example.com.csr
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example.com.crt <-- full-chain certificate
```

See [EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md) for sample executions and their output.
